# Check-if-Two-Strings-Are-Anagrams
Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters in the same frequency but in different order.
 Explanation:
We first normalize the strings by removing whitespace and converting to lowercase.

If lengths differ, they're not anagrams.

Then, we sort both strings' characters and compare them.

If the sorted character arrays match, the strings are anagrams.
